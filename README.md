This is just a basic server list for KissMP (BeamNG Multiplayer Mod)

  If you get the CORS error then there's an extension to disable it. On firefox it's called: [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)

As of right now there's no sorting but I plan on adding this at some point

- [ ] Add sorting

- [ ] Connect to server (I think it's possible)

- [ ] Tweak a bit of the CSS to make it look better

- [ ] Add a searchbar
